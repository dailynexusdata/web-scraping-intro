    "If you have dabbled even a little bit in the world of data science, you have likely heard of the term *web scraping*. **Web scraping** is the process of using automation to obtain vast amounts of data simply from sources publicly available on the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three steps required to successfully scrape a website:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Retreiving the data**\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you enter a URL into your browser and load a website on your computer, the contents of and the structure of the webpage is downloaded to your computer and displayed by your browser. This data is stored in an *HTML* file. To successfully web scrape a webpage, we must get access to this HTML data so that we can further analyze its contents.\n",
    " \n",
    "2) **Parsing the data**\n",
    "\n",
    "    How that you have access to a website's HTML data, you now have to make sense of this data. Oftentimes, a big part of this step is figuring out which components of the HTML you need -- and which ones you don't. This is often the hardest and most tedious part of web scraping, but this is where the magic really happens.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3) **Using the data**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Congratulations! Now that you have you data, you can now do something cool with it. You can analyze this data, gain new insights and knowledge, even work on your very own data science app with this data as well (with proper attribution, of course!)\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this workshop, you will learn the basics of creating your own web scraping script using the `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` package for the Python programming language. You will learn how to perform all three tasks of web scraping - retreiving the raw source HTML from a webpage, parsing that data to gain valuable data and knowledge, and storing that data to develop new insights or work on your very own data science app. We will also discuss how web scraping has been used in technologies and software commonly used today, as well as the potential ethical implications of the practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is meant to be **introductory** and is open to all skill levels. No prior knowledge of web scraping or any of the Python packages mentioned are required."

The topics covered include structure of one-pass and multiple-pass compilers; symbol table management; lexical analysis; traditional and automated parsing techniques, including recursive descent and LR parsing; syntax-directed translation and semantic analysis; run-time storage management; intermediate code generation; introduction to optimization; and code generation. The course includes a special compiler-related capstone project, which ties together concepts of algorithms, theory (formal languages), programming languages, software engineering, computer architecture, and other subjects covered in the MS curriculum. This project requires a substantial semester-long programming effort, such as construction of a language compilation or translation system that includes lexical and syntactic analyzers, a type checker, and a code generator.\\n                            \\n                            <br /><br />\\n                            <b>Prerequisites</b>: CSCI-GA 1170, CSCI-GA 2110, and CSCI-GA 2250.\\n                            \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        \\n                        </div>\\n                      </li>\\n                      \\n                      <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ga2250-001\">\\n                        <div>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring24/CSCI-GA.2250-001/\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"left\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">CSCI-GA.2250-&#8203;001</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                          <br />(8667)\\n\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n                          <a href=\"#csci-ga2250-001-desc\"\\n                            class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">\\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            Operating Systems</a>&nbsp;\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n                          \\n                            Hubertus Franke\\n                          \\n                          \\n                            \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">M 7:10-9:10PM</span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">CIWW 109</span>\\n                        \\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\"\\n                          id=\"csci-ga2250-001-desc\">\\n                          <br />\\n                          \\n                            The topics covered include a review of linkers and loaders and the high-level design of key operating systems concepts such as process scheduling and synchronization; deadlocks and their prevention; memory management, including (demand) paging and segmentation; and I/O and file systems, with examples from Unix/Linux and Windows.

<p>Large-scale distributed systems lie at the core of application domains such as cloud computing, internet of things, large multiplayer games, etc. These application domains make use of systems such as distributed databases (e.g., Google\\'s Spanner, Amazon\\'s Dynamo, etc.), large scale analytics frameworks (e.g., Hadoop, Spark and TensorFlow), distributed locking systems (e.g., Paxos, etcd, etc.), and others. In this class we will look at how to construct these distributed systems, in particular looking at why this is more complex than building applications running on a single machine, and present abstraction and design techniques for building distributed systems. We will focus on a solving a variety of common problems in these systems including consensus, consistency, naming, fault tolerance, etc.</p>\\r\\n<p>This is a graduate-level course, but undergraduates are welcome!

This course provides real world, hands&shy; on learning on what it&rsquo;s like to actually start a high&shy; tech company. This is a practical class &ndash; essentially a lab, not a theory or &ldquo;book&rdquo; class. The goal, within the constraints of a classroom and a limited amount of time, is to create an entrepreneurial experience for students with all of the pressures and demands of the real world in an early stage start up. Students will talk to customers, partners, competitors, as they encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a startup actually works. They will work in teams learning how to turn a great idea into a great company. They will learn how to use a business model to brainstorm each part of a company and customer development to get out of the classroom to see whether anyone would want/use their product. Finally, based on the customer and market feedback gathered, students will use agile development to rapidly iterate their products to build something customers would actually use and buy. Each day will be a new adventure outside the classroom as students test each part of their business model and then share the hard earned knowledge with the rest of the class.</p>\\n                            \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        \\n                        </div>\\n                      </li>\\n                      \\n                      <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ga2830-002\">\\n                        <div>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring24/CSCI-GA.2830-002/\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"left\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">CSCI-GA.2830-&#8203;002</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                          <br />(8711)\\n\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n                          <a href=\"#csci-ga2830-002-desc\"\\n                            class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">\\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            The Lean Launch Pad Lab*</a>&nbsp;\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n                          \\n                            Yiannis Broustas\\n                          \\n                          \\n                            \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">R 12:30-1:20PM</span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">60 Fifth Ave C15</span>\\n                        \\n                          <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-push-3\"><span class=\"bold\">Additional information:</span> Open only to students in the MS-CEI program</span>\\n                        \\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\"\\n                          id=\"csci-ga2830-002-desc\">\\n                          <br />\\n                          \\n                            <p><strong>Only open to MS students in the Computing, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation program.</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>This course is based on Steve Blank&rsquo;s Lean LaunchPad curriculum. This course provides real world, hands&shy; on learning on what it&rsquo;s like to actually start a high&shy; tech company. This is a practical class &ndash; essentially a lab, not a theory or &ldquo;book&rdquo; class. The goal, within the constraints of a classroom and a limited amount of time, is to create an entrepreneurial experience for students with all of the pressures and demands of the real world in an early stage start up. Students will talk to customers, partners, competitors, as they encounter the chaos and uncertainty of how a startup actually works. They will work in teams learning how to turn a great idea into a great company. They will learn how to use a business model to brainstorm each part of a company and customer development to get out of the classroom to see whether anyone would want/use their product. Finally, based on the customer and market feedback gathered, students will use agile development to rapidly iterate their products to build something customers would actually use and buy.

We will establish a basic understanding of modern computer architectures (CPUs and accelerators, memory hierarchies, interconnects) and of parallel approaches to programming these machines (distributed vs. shared memory parallelism: MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL/CUDA). Issues such as load balancing, communication, and synchronization will be covered and illustrated in the context of parallel numerical algorithms. Since a prerequisite for good parallel performance is good serial performance, this aspect will also be addressed. Along the way you will be exposed to important tools for high performance computing such as debuggers, schedulers, visualization, and version control systems. This will be a hands-on class, with several parallel (and serial) computing assignments, in which you will explore material by yourself and try things out. There will be a larger final project at the end. You will learn some Unix in this course, if you don&#39;t know it already.</p>\\n                            \\n                            <br /><br />\\n                            <b>Prerequisites</b>: Prerequisites for the course are (serial) programming experience with C/C++ (I will use C in class) or FORTRAN, and some familiarity with numerical methods.\\n                            \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        \\n                        </div>\\n                      </li>\\n                      \\n                      <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ga3033-026\">\\n                        <div>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring24/CSCI-GA.3033-026/\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"left\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">CSCI-GA.3033-&#8203;026</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                          <br />(8688)\\n\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n                          <a href=\"#csci-ga3033-026-desc\"\\n                            class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">\\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                              \\n                                Special Topics:\\n                              \\n                            \\n                            Cloud Computing</a>&nbsp;\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/~jcf/\">Jean-Claude Franchitti</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                            \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">R 7:10-9:10PM</span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">CIWW 101</span>\\n                        \\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\"\\n                          id=\"csci-ga3033-026-desc\">\\n                          <br />\\n                          \\n                            <p>This course is a capstone course that introduces the latest cloud multi-access computing platform services including support for Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Web3 decentralized platforms, and other technologies. These services may be leveraged to create industry 4.0 and 5.0 innovative Intelligent Autonomous Networked (IAN) business solutions and deploy them on hybrid multi-cloud platforms so they can operate at the network edge to minimize latency and power consumption. Students will learn about services provided on the top &ldquo;Big Clouds&rdquo;, namely Amazon AWS Cloud, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Salesforce, and others. Related services provided on the Cloud and covered in the course include computing and hosting services, storage services, networking services, container management services (e.g., K8s), and shallow/deep machine learning services. Once familiar with Cloud services, Students will learn how to combine them to support cognitive computing and enable the creation of IAN solutions that cater to the practical needs of industry 4.0/5.0 and society 5.0 users in novel and creative ways. As they create these IAN solutions, students will learn about immersive Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) User Experience and Interfaces (UX/UI), hybrid decentralized computing and DApps, multi-access computing and Internet of Things (IoT), Mobility/5G networking and Software Defined Network (SDN) infrastructures, advanced robotics, and various key aspects of digital security that are critical to ensure the safety of modern software solutions. Throughout the course, students will develop their own Intelligent Autonomous Networked (IAN) business solutions using Cloud-based shallow/deep machine learning and other services and capabilities as noted above. Sample platforms and related application components will be provided as applicable to speed up the development and deployment process.</p>\\n                            \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        \\n                        </div>\\n                      </li>\\n                      \\n                      <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ga3033-029\">\\n                        <div>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring24/CSCI-GA.3033-029/\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"left\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">CSCI-GA.3033-&#8203;029</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                          <br />(8689)\\n\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n                          <a href=\"#csci-ga3033-029-desc\"\\n                            class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">\\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                              \\n                                Special Topics:\\n                              \\n                            \\n                            Social Networks</a>&nbsp;\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n                          \\n                             CANCELLED\\n                          \\n                          \\n                            \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\"> -</span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\"> </span>\\n                        \\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\"\\n                          id=\"csci-ga3033-029-desc\">\\n                          <br />\\n                          \\n                            <p>Social Networks is a specific example of many forms of networks that have become ubiquitous in our modern society. The World Wide Web enables information flows among vast number of humans; Facebook, and LinkedIn, etc. connect small groups of friends; amazon, eBay, etc. provide opportunities for trading, etc, BitCoins, Ethereum, etc. allow parties to make financial and contractual transactions . These networks determine our information, influence our opinions, and shape our political attitudes. They also link us, often through important but weak ties, to other humans. Their origin is biological: going back to quorumsensing, swarming, flocking, social grooming, gossip, etc., and have evolved with the dynamics of evolutionary games (particularly Signaling Games). Yet, as we have connected our social networks to traditional human institutions (markets, justice systems, education, etc.) through new technologies, the underlying biology has become obscured, but not dormant. Economic markets also look much more like networks than anonymous marketplaces. Firms interact with the suppliers and customers in a Web-like supply chains. Systemic risk in financial markets often results from the counterparty risks created within this financial network.

Starting with the seminal work of Goemans and Williamson in early 90s, several approximation algorithms have been designed based on a semi-definite programming relaxation followed by a rounding scheme. This course&nbsp; will cover many of these SDP-based algorithms along with other applications of SDPs in computer science. The course will also cover hardness of approximation results, showing that for several NP-hard problems, it remains NP-hard to compute approximations beyond a certain threshold.</p>\\n                            \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        \\n                        </div>\\n                      </li>\\n                      \\n                      <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ga3033-107\">\\n                        <div>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring24/CSCI-GA.3033-107/\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"left\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">CSCI-GA.3033-&#8203;107</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                          <br />(8699)\\n\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n                          <a href=\"#csci-ga3033-107-desc\"\\n                            class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">\\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                              \\n                                Special Topics:\\n                              \\n                            \\n                            Cryptography of Blockchains</a>&nbsp;\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://bue.nz\">Benedikt Bünz</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                            \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">M 10:15-12:15PM</span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">60 Fifth Ave C15</span>\\n                        \\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\"\\n                          id=\"csci-ga3033-107-desc\">\\n                          <br />\\n                          \\n                            <p>Blockchains are distributed systems that are secured using consensus protocols, game theoretic incentives and cryptographic primitives.

Despite such impact and successes, the currently dominant paradigm of machine learning, broadly represented by deep learning, relies almost entirely on capturing statistical correlations among features from data. As the famous phrase &ldquo;correlation does not imply causation&rdquo; suggests, such correlation-driven approaches cannot uncover causal relationships among variables of interest. In this introductory course, we aim to provide early-year M.Sc. and Ph.D students, who are already familiar with machine learning, with the foundational ideas and techniques in causal inference so that they can expand their knowledge and expertise beyond correlation-driven machine learning.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nRecommended courses: DS-GA 1005 Inference and Representation, DS-GA 1008 Deep Learning</p>\\n                            \\n                            <br /><br />\\n                            <b>Prerequisites</b>: DS-GA 1001 Introduction to Data Science (or an equivalent course); DS-GA 1002 Probability and Statistics for Data Science (or an equivalent course); DS-GA 1003 Machine Learning (or an equivalent course)\\n                            \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        \\n                        </div>\\n                      </li>\\n                      \\n                      <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ga3033-109\">\\n                        <div>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring24/CSCI-GA.3033-109/\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"left\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">CSCI-GA.3033-&#8203;109</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                          <br />(20042)\\n\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n                          <a href=\"#csci-ga3033-109-desc\"\\n                            class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">\\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                              \\n                                Special Topics:\\n                              \\n                            \\n                            Computer Vision for Science and Engineering</a>&nbsp;\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"https://cs.nyu.edu/~fouhey/\">David Fouhey</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                            \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">T 4:55-6:55PM</span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">CIWW 202</span>\\n                        \\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\"\\n                          id=\"csci-ga3033-109-desc\">\\n                          <br />\\n                          \\n                            <p>One of the most important emerging areas for computer vision and machine learning is in helping the sciences and engineering extract more and better information from their data.

Second, actual security mechanisms and protocols, mainly those employed for network traffic that rely on the previously introduced cryptographic algorithms, are presented. The topics covered include introduction to basic number-theoretical properties, public/private and symmetric key systems, secure hash functions, digital signature standards, digital certificates, IP security, e-mail security, Web security, and stand-alone computer privacy and security tools.\\n                            \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        \\n                        </div>\\n                      </li>\\n                      \\n                      <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ga3812-001\">\\n                        <div>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring24/CSCI-GA.3812-001/\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"left\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">CSCI-GA.3812-&#8203;001</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                          <br />(8703)\\n\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n                          <a href=\"#csci-ga3812-001-desc\"\\n                            class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">\\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            Information Technology Projects *</a>&nbsp;\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/~korth/\">Evan Korth</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                            \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">W 5:00-8:00PM</span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">CIWW 317</span>\\n                        \\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\"\\n                          id=\"csci-ga3812-001-desc\">\\n                          <br />\\n                          \\n                            <p>This is a capstone course that connects students directly with real-world information technology problems. The goal of this course is to teach the skills needed for success in real-world information technology via a combination of classroom lectures and practical experience with large projects that have been specified by local &ldquo;clients.&rdquo; The typical clients are primarily companies, but can also be government agencies or nonprofit organizations. Each project lasts for the entire semester and is designed to involve the full software project life cycle. Examples of such projects are development of software to solve a business problem, including specifying requirements, writing and testing prototype code, and writing a final report; and evaluation of commercial software to be purchased to address a business problem, including gathering requirements, designing an architecture to connect the new software with existing systems, and assessing the suitability of available software products.</p>\\n                            \\n                            <br /><br />\\n                            <b>Prerequisites</b>: For MS in IS students: Successful completion of CSCI-GA 1170 Fundamental Algorithms and two of the following three courses: CSCI-GA 2262 Data Communications &amp; Networks; CSCI-GA 2250 Operating Systems; CSCI-GA 2433 Database Systems.

Typical applications include: information extraction (automatically finding information from text); information retrieval (web searches and other applications involving the automatic selection of &quot;relevant&quot; documents); sentiment analysis (automatic extraction of opinions about a set of issues); and machine translation (automatically translating one natural language to another). Much of the best work in the field combines two methodologies: (1) automatically acquiring statistical information from one set of &quot;training&quot; documents to use as the basis for probabilistically predicting the distribution of similar information in new documents; and (2) using manually encoded linguistic knowledge. For example, many supervised methods of machine learning require: a corpus of text with manually encoded linguistic knowledge, a set of procedures for acquiring statistical patterns from this data and a transducer for predicting these same distinctions in new text. This class will cover linguistic, statistical and computational aspects of this exciting field.</p>\\n                            \\n                            <br /><br />\\n                            <b>Prerequisites</b>: &lt;p&gt;CSCI-UA.0201 with a grade of C or better&lt;/p&gt;\\n                            \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        \\n                        </div>\\n                      </li>\\n                      \\n                      <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ua0470-001\">\\n                        <div>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring24/CSCI-UA.0470-001/\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"left\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">CSCI-UA.0470-&#8203;001</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                          <br />(8015)\\n\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n                          <a href=\"#csci-ua0470-001-desc\"\\n                            class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">\\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            Object Oriented Programming</a>&nbsp;\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"https://cs.nyu.edu/~ha2285/\">Hasan Aljabbouli</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                            \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">MW 9:30-10:45AM</span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">Silv 401</span>\\n                        \\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\"\\n                          id=\"csci-ua0470-001-desc\">\\n                          <br />\\n                          \\n                            <p>Introduces the important concepts of object-oriented design and languages, including code reuse, data abstraction, inheritance, and dynamic overloading.

Most of our devices are now multicore processors. A multicore processor contains several cores (called CPUs or cores) on-chip. There are also accelerator chips, like GPUs. To make the best use of these multicore chips, we need to program them in-parallel. Sequential programming, for all platforms from smartphones to supercomputers, is falling out of fashion and taking a back-seat to parallel programming. How to think in parallel? How to write code in parallel to make the best use of the underlying hardware? How is this hardware different from the traditional one? What will the future be for software and hardware? This is what this course is about.</p>\\n                            \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        \\n                        </div>\\n                      </li>\\n                      \\n                      <li class=\"row\" id=\"csci-ua0480-061\">\\n                        <div>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3 italic\" style=\"word-wrap:break-word;\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring24/CSCI-UA.0480-061/\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"left\" title=\"NYU Home login required to view course page\">CSCI-UA.0480-&#8203;061</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                          <br />(8022)\\n\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-3\">\\n                          <a href=\"#csci-ua0480-061-desc\"\\n                            class=\"expand\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">\\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                            \\n                              \\n                                Special Topics:\\n                              \\n                            \\n                            Open Source Software Development</a>&nbsp;\\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">\\n                          \\n                            <a href=\"http://cs.nyu.edu/~joannakl/\">Joanna Klukowska</a>\\n                          \\n                          \\n                            \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                          \\n                        </span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">MW 12:30-1:45PM</span>\\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-2\">194M 305</span>\\n                        \\n                        <span class=\"col-xs-12 collapse expandable\"\\n                          id=\"csci-ua0480-061-desc\">\\n                          <br />\\n                          \\n                            Detailed course descriptions are available when advanced topics are announced each semester.

The field of DevOps, a portmanteau of development and operations, has introduced further processes and infrastructure to automate many of the tasks required in such development. Together, an Agile methodology and DevOps automation have increased the speed, robustness, and scalability with which software is developed today and have reduced the uncertainty of outcomes inherent in complex software development.

The course includes a special compiler-related capstone project, which ties together concepts of algorithms, theory (formal languages), programming languages, software engineering, computer architecture, and other subjects covered in the MS curriculum. This project requires a substantial semester-long programming effort, such as construction of a language compilation or translation system that includes lexical and syntactic analyzers, a type checker, and a code generator.\n",

They will work in teams learning how to turn a great idea into a great company. They will learn how to use a business model to brainstorm each part of a company and customer development to get out of the classroom to see whether anyone would want/use their product. Finally, based on the customer and market feedback gathered, students will use agile development to rapidly iterate their products to build something customers would actually use and buy.

      "             This class will be an introduction to the fundamentals of parallel scientific computing. We will establish a basic understanding of modern computer architectures (CPUs and accelerators, memory hierarchies, interconnects) and of parallel approaches to programming these machines (distributed vs. shared memory parallelism: MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL/CUDA). Issues such as load balancing, communication, and synchronization will be covered and illustrated in the context of parallel numerical algorithms. Since a prerequisite for good parallel performance is good serial performance, this aspect will also be addressed. Along the way you will be exposed to important tools for high performance computing such as debuggers, schedulers, visualization, and version control systems. This will be a hands-on class, with several parallel (and serial) computing assignments, in which you will explore material by yourself and try things out. There will be a larger final project at the end. You will learn some Unix in this course, if you don't know it already.\n",

      "             Social Networks is a specific example of many forms of networks that have become ubiquitous in our modern society. The World Wide Web enables information flows among vast number of humans; Facebook, and LinkedIn, etc. connect small groups of friends; amazon, eBay, etc. provide opportunities for trading, etc, BitCoins, Ethereum, etc. allow parties to make financial and contractual transactions . These networks determine our information, influence our opinions, and shape our political attitudes. They also link us, often through important but weak ties, to other humans. Their origin is biological: going back to quorumsensing, swarming, flocking, social grooming, gossip, etc., and have evolved with the dynamics of evolutionary games (particularly Signaling Games). Yet, as we have connected our social networks to traditional human institutions (markets, justice systems, education, etc.) through new technologies, the underlying biology has become obscured, but not dormant. Economic markets also look much more like networks than anonymous marketplaces. Firms interact with the suppliers and customers in a Web-like supply chains. Systemic risk in financial markets often results from the counterparty risks created within this financial network. This course will introduce the tools for the study of networks, and mechanism designed to interact strategically: SmartContractss, Costly Signaling, Credible and Noncredible Threats, Model Checking and Verification, Safety and Liveness, Recommenders and Verifiers, Deception, Market mechanisms (pricing and auction), Privacy and Trust… Exampled Systems: Bit-coins, Zcash, Ripple, Stellar, Ethereum, Solidity, Rholang, DAO (Distributed Companies), Cyber Security (M-coins), Information Finance Markets (WealthFront, etc.), Market Microstructure, ICO/STO/ITO, GDPR, OpenLaw, OpenZeplin, ...\n",

Starting with the seminal work of Goemans and Williamson in early 90s, several approximation algorithms have been designed based on a semi-definite programming relaxation followed by a rounding scheme. This course  will cover many of these SDP-based algorithms along with other applications of SDPs in computer science. The course will also cover hardness of approximation results, showing that for several NP-hard problems, it remains NP-hard to compute approximations beyond a certain threshold.\n",

      "             Recent advances and successes in machine learning have had tremendous impacts on society. Despite such impact and successes, the currently dominant paradigm of machine learning, broadly represented by deep learning, relies almost entirely on capturing statistical correlations among features from data. As the famous phrase “correlation does not imply causation” suggests, such correlation-driven approaches cannot uncover causal relationships among variables of interest. In this introductory course, we aim to provide early-year M.Sc. and Ph.D students, who are already familiar with machine learning, with the foundational ideas and techniques in causal inference so that they can expand their knowledge and expertise beyond correlation-driven machine learning.\n",

To the extent feasible, the mathematical properties of the cryptographic algorithms are justified, using elementary mathematical tools. Second, actual security mechanisms and protocols, mainly those employed for network traffic that rely on the previously introduced cryptographic algorithms, are presented. The topics covered include introduction to basic number-theoretical properties, public/private and symmetric key systems, secure hash functions, digital signature standards, digital certificates, IP security, e-mail security, Web security, and stand-alone computer privacy and security tools.\n",

The goal of this course is to teach the skills needed for success in real-world information technology via a combination of classroom lectures and practical experience with large projects that have been specified by local “clients.” The typical clients are primarily companies, but can also be government agencies or nonprofit organizations. Each project lasts for the entire semester and is designed to involve the full software project life cycle. Examples of such projects are development of software to solve a business problem, including specifying requirements, writing and testing prototype code, and writing a final report; and evaluation of commercial software to be purchased to address a business problem, including gathering requirements, designing an architecture to connect the new software with existing systems, and assessing the suitability of available software products.\n",

      "             Natural Language Processing (aka Computational Linguistics) is an inter-disciplinary field applying methodology of computer science and linguistics to the processing of natural languages (English, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, etc.). Typical applications include: information extraction (automatically finding information from text); information retrieval (web searches and other applications involving the automatic selection of \"relevant\" documents); sentiment analysis (automatic extraction of opinions about a set of issues); and machine translation (automatically translating one natural language to another). Much of the best work in the field combines two methodologies: (1) automatically acquiring statistical information from one set of \"training\" documents to use as the basis for probabilistically predicting the distribution of similar information in new documents; and (2) using manually encoded linguistic knowledge. For example, many supervised methods of machine learning require: a corpus of text with manually encoded linguistic knowledge, a set of procedures for acquiring statistical patterns from this data and a transducer for predicting these same distinctions in new text. This class will cover linguistic, statistical and computational aspects of this exciting field.\n",

      "             A microprocessor with a single core no longer exists in almost all computers we are using today (including your tablet, smartphone, and even smartwatch). Most of our devices are now multicore processors. A multicore processor contains several cores (called CPUs or cores) on-chip. There are also accelerator chips, like GPUs. To make the best use of these multicore chips, we need to program them in-parallel. Sequential programming, for all platforms from smartphones to supercomputers, is falling out of fashion and taking a back-seat to parallel programming. How to think in parallel? How to write code in parallel to make the best use of the underlying hardware? How is this hardware different from the traditional one? What will the future be for software and hardware? This is what this course is about.\n",

The field of DevOps, a portmanteau of development and operations, has introduced further processes and infrastructure to automate many of the tasks required in such development. Together, an Agile methodology and DevOps automation have increased the speed, robustness, and scalability with which software is developed today and have reduced the uncertainty of outcomes inherent in complex software development.

But circumstances are against our doing so. I am at present\\n      engaged upon a new dramatic work, which for several reasons has made very\\n      slow progress, and I do not leave Munich until I can take with me the\\n      completed first draft. There is little or no prospect of my being able to\\n      complete it in July.\" Ibsen did not leave Munich at all that season. On\\n      October 30 he wrote: \"At present I am utterly engrossed in a new play. Not\\n      one leisure hour have I had for several months.\" Three weeks later\\n      (November 20) he wrote to his French translator, Count Prozor: \"My new\\n      play is finished; the manuscript went off to Copenhagen the day before\\n      yesterday.... It produces a curious feeling of emptiness to be thus\\n      suddenly separated from a work which has occupied one\\'s time and thoughts\\n      for several months, to the exclusion of all else. But it is a good thing,\\n      too, to have done with it. The constant intercourse with the fictitious\\n      personages was beginning to make me quite nervous.\" To the same\\n      correspondent he wrote on December 4: \"The title of the play is <i>Hedda\\n      Gabler</i>. My intention in giving it this name was to indicate that\\n      Hedda, as a personality, is to be regarded rather as her father\\'s daughter\\n      than as her husband\\'s wife. It was not my desire to deal in this play with\\n      so-called problems. What I principally wanted to do was to depict human\\n      beings, human emotions, and human destinies, upon a groundwork of certain\\n      of the social conditions and principles of the present day.\"\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      So far we read the history of the play in the official \"Correspondence.\"<a\\n      name=\"H1\" id=\"H1\"></a>(<a href=\"#linka\">A</a>) Some interesting\\n      glimpses into the poet\\'s moods during the period between the completion of\\n      <i>The Lady from the Sea</i> and the publication of <i>Hedda Gabler</i>\\n      are to be found in the series of letters to Fraulein Emilie Bardach, of\\n      Vienna, published by Dr. George Brandes.<a name=\"H2\" id=\"H2\"></a>(<a\\n      href=\"#linkb\">B</a>) This young lady Ibsen met at Gossensass in the Tyrol\\n      in the autumn of 1889. The record of their brief friendship belongs to the\\n      history of <i>The Master Builder</i> rather than to that of <i>Hedda\\n      Gabler</i>, but the allusions to his work in his letters to her during the\\n      winter of 1889 demand some examination.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      So early as October 7, 1889, he writes to her: \"A new poem begins to dawn\\n      in me. I will execute it this winter, and try to transfer to it the bright\\n      atmosphere of the summer. But I feel that it will end in sadness&mdash;such\\n      is my nature.\" Was this \"dawning\" poem <i>Hedda Gabler</i>? Or was it\\n      rather <i>The Master Builder</i> that was germinating in his mind? Who\\n      shall say? The latter hypothesis seems the more probable, for it is hard\\n      to believe that at any stage in the incubation of <i>Hedda Gabler</i> he\\n      can have conceived it as even beginning in gaiety. A week later, however,\\n      he appears to have made up his mind that the time had not come for the\\n      poetic utilisation of his recent experiences. He writes on October 15:\\n      \"Here I sit as usual at my writing-table. Now I would fain work, but am\\n      unable to. My fancy, indeed, is very active. But it always wanders away\\n      ours. I cannot repress my summer memories&mdash;nor do I wish to. I live\\n      through my experience again and again and yet again. To transmute it all\\n      into a poem, I find, in the meantime, impossible.\" Clearly, then, he felt\\n      that his imagination ought to have been engaged on some theme having no\\n      relation to his summer experiences&mdash;the theme, no doubt, of <i>Hedda\\n      Gabler</i>. In his next letter, dated October 29, he writes: \"Do not be\\n      troubled because I cannot, in the meantime, create (<i>dichten</i>). In\\n      reality I am for ever creating, or, at any rate, dreaming of something\\n      which, when in the fulness of time it ripens, will reveal itself as a\\n      creation (<i>Dichtung</i>).\" On November 19 he says: \"I am very busily\\n      occupied with preparations for my new poem. I sit almost the whole day at\\n      my writing-table. Go out only in the evening for a little while.\" The five\\n      following letters contain no allusion to the play; but on September 18,\\n      1890, he wrote: \"My wife and son are at present at Riva, on the Lake of\\n      Garda, and will probably remain there until the middle of October, or even\\n      longer. Thus I am quite alone here, and cannot get away. The new play on\\n      which I am at present engaged will probably not be ready until November,\\n      though I sit at my writing-table daily, and almost the whole day long.\"\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Here ends the history of <i>Hedda Gabler</i>, so far as the poet\\'s letters\\n      carry us. Its hard clear outlines, and perhaps somewhat bleak atmosphere,\\n      seem to have resulted from a sort of reaction against the sentimental\\n      \"dreamery\" begotten of his Gossensass experiences. He sought refuge in the\\n      chill materialism of Hedda from the ardent transcendentalism of Hilda,\\n      whom he already heard knocking at the door. He was not yet in the mood to\\n      deal with her on the plane of poetry.<a name=\"H3\" id=\"H3\"></a>(<a\\n      href=\"#linkc\">C</a>)\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      <i>Hedda Gabler</i> was published in Copenhagen on December 16, 1890. This\\n      was the first of Ibsen\\'s plays to be translated from proof-sheets and\\n      published in England and America almost simultaneously with its first\\n      appearance in Scandinavia. The earliest theatrical performance took place\\n      at the Residenz Theater, Munich, on the last day of January 1891, in the\\n      presence of the poet, Frau Conrad-Ramlo playing the title-part. The\\n      Lessing Theater, Berlin, followed suit on February 10. Not till February\\n      25 was the play seen in Copenhagen, with Fru Hennings as Hedda. On the\\n      following night it was given for the first time in Christiania, the\\n      Norwegian Hedda being Froken Constance Bruun. It was this production which\\n      the poet saw when he visited the Christiania Theater for the first time\\n      after his return to Norway, August 28, 1891. It would take pages to give\\n      even the baldest list of the productions and revivals of <i>Hedda Gabler</i>\\n      in Scandinavia and Germany, where it has always ranked among Ibsen\\'s most\\n      popular works. The admirable production of the play by Miss Elizabeth\\n      Robins and Miss Marion Lea, at the Vaudeville Theatre, London, April 20,\\n      1891, may rank as the second great step towards the popularisation of\\n      Ibsen in England, the first being the Charrington-Achurch production of <i>A\\n      Doll\\'s House</i> in 1889. Miss Robins afterwards repeated her fine\\n      performance of Hedda many times, in London, in the English provinces, and\\n      in New York. The character has also been acted in London by Eleonora Duse,\\n      and as I write (March, 5, 1907) by Mrs. Patrick Campbell, at the Court\\n      Theatre. In Australia and America, Hedda has frequently been acted by Miss\\n      Nance O\\'Neill and other actresses&mdash;quite recently by a Russian\\n      actress, Madame Alla Nazimova, who (playing in English) seems to have made\\n      a notable success both in this part and in Nora. The first French Hedda\\n      Gabler was Mlle. Marthe Brandes, who played the part at the Vaudeville\\n      Theatre, Paris, on December 17, 1891, the performance being introduced by\\n      a lecture by M. Jules Lemaitre. In Holland, in Italy, in Russia, the play\\n      has been acted times without number. In short (as might easily have been\\n      foretold) it has rivalled <i>A Doll\\'s House</i> in world-wide popularity.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      It has been suggested,<a name=\"H4\" id=\"H4\"></a>(<a href=\"#linkd\">D</a>)\\n      I think without sufficient ground, that Ibsen deliberately conceived <i>Hedda\\n      Gabler</i> as an \"international\" play, and that the scene is really the\\n      \"west end\" of any European city. To me it seems quite clear that Ibsen had\\n      Christiania in mind, and the Christiania of a somewhat earlier period than\\n      the \\'nineties. The electric cars, telephones, and other conspicuous\\n      factors in the life of a modern capital are notably absent from the play.\\n      There is no electric light in Secretary Falk\\'s villa. It is still the\\n      habit for ladies to return on foot from evening parties, with gallant\\n      swains escorting them. This \"suburbanism,\" which so distressed the London\\n      critics of 1891, was characteristic of the Christiania Ibsen himself had\\n      known in the \\'sixties&mdash;the Christiania of <i>Love\\'s Comedy</i>&mdash;rather\\n      than of the greatly extended and modernised city of the end of the\\n      century. Moreover Lovborg\\'s allusions to the fiord, and the suggested\\n      picture of Sheriff Elvsted, his family and his avocations are all\\n      distinctively Norwegian. The truth seems to be very simple&mdash;the\\n      environment and the subsidiary personages are all thoroughly national, but\\n      Hedda herself is an \"international\" type, a product of civilisation by no\\n      means peculiar to Norway.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      We cannot point to any individual model or models who \"sat to\" Ibsen for\\n      the character of Hedda.<a name=\"H5\" id=\"H5\"></a>(<a href=\"#linke\">E</a>)\\n      The late Grant Allen declared that Hedda was \"nothing more nor less than\\n      the girl we take down to dinner in London nineteen times out of twenty\";\\n      in which case Ibsen must have suffered from a superfluidity of models,\\n      rather than from any difficulty in finding one. But the fact is that in\\n      this, as in all other instances, the word \"model\" must be taken in a very\\n      different sense from that in which it is commonly used in painting. Ibsen\\n      undoubtedly used models for this trait and that, but never for a whole\\n      figure. If his characters can be called portraits at all, they are\\n      composite portraits. Even when it seems pretty clear that the initial\\n      impulse towards the creation of a particular character came from some\\n      individual, the original figure is entirely transmuted in the process of\\n      harmonisation with the dramatic scheme. We need not, therefore, look for a\\n      definite prototype of Hedda; but Dr. Brandes shows that two of that lady\\'s\\n      exploits were probably suggested by the anecdotic history of the day.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Ibsen had no doubt heard how the wife of a well-known Norwegian composer,\\n      in a fit of raging jealousy excited by her husband\\'s prolonged absence\\n      from home, burnt the manuscript of a symphony which he had just finished.\\n      The circumstances under which Hedda burns Lovborg\\'s manuscript are, of\\n      course, entirely different and infinitely more dramatic; but here we have\\n      merely another instance of the dramatisation or \"poetisation\" of the raw\\n      material of life. Again, a still more painful incident probably came to\\n      his knowledge about the same time. A beautiful and very intellectual woman\\n      was married to a well-known man who had been addicted to drink, but had\\n      entirely conquered the vice. One day a mad whim seized her to put his\\n      self-mastery and her power over him to the test. As it happened to be his\\n      birthday, she rolled into his study a small keg of brandy, and then\\n      withdrew. She returned some time after wards to find that he had broached\\n      the keg, and lay insensible on the floor. In this anecdote we cannot but\\n      recognise the germ, not only of Hedda\\'s temptation of Lovborg, but of a\\n      large part of her character.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      \"Thus,\" says Dr. Brandes, \"out of small and scattered traits of reality\\n      Ibsen fashioned his close-knit and profoundly thought-out works of art.\"\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      For the character of Eilert Lovborg, again, Ibsen seem unquestionably to\\n      have borrowed several traits from a definite original. A young Danish man\\n      of letters, whom Dr. Brandes calls Holm, was an enthusiastic admirer of\\n      Ibsen, and came to be on very friendly terms with him. One day Ibsen was\\n      astonished to receive, in Munich, a parcel addressed from Berlin by this\\n      young man, containing, without a word of explanation, a packet of his\\n      (Ibsen\\'s) letters, and a photograph which he had presented to Holm. Ibsen\\n      brooded and brooded over the incident, and at last came to the conclusion\\n      that the young man had intended to return her letters and photograph to a\\n      young lady to whom he was known to be attached, and had in a fit of\\n      aberration mixed up the two objects of his worship. Some time after, Holm\\n      appeared at Ibsen\\'s rooms. He talked quite rationally, but professed to\\n      have no knowledge whatever of the letter-incident, though he admitted the\\n      truth of Ibsen\\'s conjecture that the \"belle dame sans merci\" had demanded\\n      the return of her letters and portrait. Ibsen was determined to get at the\\n      root of the mystery; and a little inquiry into his young friend\\'s habits\\n      revealed the fact that he broke his fast on a bottle of port wine,\\n      consumed a bottle of Rhine wine at lunch, of Burgundy at dinner, and\\n      finished off the evening with one or two more bottles of port. Then he\\n      heard, too, how, in the course of a night\\'s carouse, Holm had lost the\\n      manuscript of a book; and in these traits he saw the outline of the figure\\n      of Eilert Lovborg.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Some time elapsed, and again Ibsen received a postal packet from Holm.\\n      This one contained his will, in which Ibsen figured as his residuary\\n      legatee. But many other legatees were mentioned in the instrument&mdash;all\\n      of them ladies, such as Fraulein Alma Rothbart, of Bremen, and Fraulein\\n      Elise Kraushaar, of Berlin. The bequests to these meritorious spinsters\\n      were so generous that their sum considerably exceeded the amount of the\\n      testator\\'s property. Ibsen gently but firmly declined the proffered\\n      inheritance; but Holm\\'s will no doubt suggested to him the figure of that\\n      red-haired \"Mademoiselle Diana,\" who is heard of but not seen in <i>Hedda\\n      Gabler</i>, and enabled him to add some further traits to the portraiture\\n      of Lovborg. When the play appeared, Holm recognised himself with glee in\\n      the character of the bibulous man of letters, and thereafter adopted\\n      \"Eilert Lovborg\" as his pseudonym. I do not, therefore, see why Dr.\\n      Brandes should suppress his real name; but I willingly imitate him in\\n      erring on the side of discretion. The poor fellow died several years ago.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Some critics have been greatly troubled as to the precise meaning of\\n      Hedda\\'s fantastic vision of Lovborg \"with vine-leaves in his hair.\" Surely\\n      this is a very obvious image or symbol of the beautiful, the ideal, aspect\\n      of bacchic elation and revelry. Antique art, or I am much mistaken, shows\\n      us many figures of Dionysus himself and his followers with vine-leaves\\n      entwined their hair. To Ibsen\\'s mind, at any rate, the image had long been\\n      familiar. In <i>Peer Gynt</i> (Act iv. sc. 8), when Peer, having carried\\n      off Anitra, finds himself in a particularly festive mood, he cries: \"Were\\n      there vine-leaves around, I would garland my brow.\" Again, in <i>Emperor\\n      and Galilean</i> (Pt. ii. Act 1) where Julian, in the procession of\\n      Dionysus, impersonates the god himself, it is directed that he shall wear\\n      a wreath of vine-leaves. Professor Dietrichson relates that among the\\n      young artists whose society Ibsen frequented during his first years in\\n      Rome, it was customary, at their little festivals, for the revellers to\\n      deck themselves in this fashion. But the image is so obvious that there is\\n      no need to trace it to any personal experience. The attempt to place\\n      Hedda\\'s vine-leaves among Ibsen\\'s obscurities is an example of the firm\\n      resolution not to understand which animated the criticism of the\\n      \\'nineties.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Dr. Brandes has dealt very severely with the character of Eilert Lovborg,\\n      alleging that we cannot believe in the genius attributed to him. But where\\n      is he described as a genius? The poet represents him as a very able\\n      student of sociology; but that is quite a different thing from attributing\\n      to him such genius as must necessarily shine forth in every word he\\n      utters. Dr. Brandes, indeed, declines to believe even in his ability as a\\n      sociologist, on the ground that it is idle to write about the social\\n      development of the future. \"To our prosaic minds,\" he says, \"it may seem\\n      as if the most sensible utterance on the subject is that of the fool of\\n      the play: \\'The future! Good heavens, we know nothing of the future.\\'\" The\\n      best retort to this criticism is that which Eilert himself makes: \"There\\'s\\n      a thing or two to be said about it all the same.\" The intelligent\\n      forecasting of the future (as Mr. H. G. Wells has shown) is not only\\n      clearly distinguishable from fantastic Utopianism, but is indispensable to\\n      any large statesmanship or enlightened social activity. With very real and\\n      very great respect for Dr. Brandes, I cannot think that he has been\\n      fortunate in his treatment of Lovborg\\'s character. It has been represented\\n      as an absurdity that he would think of reading abstracts from his new book\\n      to a man like Tesman, whom he despises. But though Tesman is a ninny, he\\n      is, as Hedda says, a \"specialist\"&mdash;he is a competent, plodding\\n      student of his subject. Lovborg may quite naturally wish to see how his\\n      new method, or his excursion into a new field, strikes the average scholar\\n      of the Tesman type. He is, in fact, \"trying it on the dog\"&mdash;neither\\n      an unreasonable nor an unusual proceeding. There is, no doubt, a certain\\n      improbability in the way in which Lovborg is represented as carrying his\\n      manuscript around, and especially in Mrs. Elvsted\\'s production of his\\n      rough draft from her pocket; but these are mechanical trifles, on which\\n      only a niggling criticism would dream of laying stress.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Of all Ibsen\\'s works, <i>Hedda Gabler</i> is the most detached, the most\\n      objective&mdash;a character-study pure and simple. It is impossible&mdash;or\\n      so it seems to me&mdash;to extract any sort of general idea from it. One\\n      cannot even call it a satire, unless one is prepared to apply that term to\\n      the record of a \"case\" in a work of criminology. Reverting to Dumas\\'s\\n      dictum that a play should contain \"a painting, a judgment, an ideal,\" we\\n      may say the <i>Hedda Gabler</i> fulfils only the first of these\\n      requirements. The poet does not even pass judgment on his heroine: he\\n      simply paints her full-length portrait with scientific impassivity. But\\n      what a portrait! How searching in insight, how brilliant in colouring, how\\n      rich in detail! Grant Allen\\'s remark, above quoted, was, of course, a\\n      whimsical exaggeration; the Hedda type is not so common as all that, else\\n      the world would quickly come to an end. But particular traits and\\n      tendencies of the Hedda type are very common in modern life, and not only\\n      among women. Hyperaesthesia lies at the root of her tragedy. With a keenly\\n      critical, relentlessly solvent intelligence, she combines a morbid\\n      shrinking from all the gross and prosaic detail of the sensual life. She\\n      has nothing to take her out of herself&mdash;not a single intellectual\\n      interest or moral enthusiasm. She cherishes, in a languid way, a petty\\n      social ambition; and even that she finds obstructed and baffled. At the\\n      same time she learns that another woman has had the courage to love and\\n      venture all, where she, in her cowardice, only hankered and refrained. Her\\n      malign egoism rises up uncontrolled, and calls to its aid her quick and\\n      subtle intellect. She ruins the other woman\\'s happiness, but in doing so\\n      incurs a danger from which her sense of personal dignity revolts. Life has\\n      no such charm for her that she cares to purchase it at the cost of squalid\\n      humiliation and self-contempt. The good and the bad in her alike impel her\\n      to have done with it all; and a pistol-shot ends what is surely one of the\\n      most poignant character-tragedies in literature. Ibsen\\'s brain never\\n      worked at higher pressure than in the conception and adjustment of those\\n      \"crowded hours\" in which Hedda, tangled in the web of Will and\\n      Circumstance, struggles on till she is too weary to struggle any more.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      It may not be superfluous to note that the \"a\" in \"Gabler\" should be\\n      sounded long and full, like the \"a\" in \"Garden\"&mdash;NOT like the \"a\" in\\n      \"gable\" or in \"gabble.\"\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      W.

In the right-hand\\n  wall of the front room, a folding door leading out to the\\n  hall.  In the opposite wall, on the left, a glass door, also\\n  with curtains drawn back.  Through the panes can be seen\\n  part of a verandah outside, and trees covered with autumn\\n  foliage.  An oval table, with a cover on it, and surrounded\\n  by chairs, stands well forward.  In front, by the wall on\\n  the right, a wide stove of dark porcelain, a high-backed\\n  arm-chair, a cushioned foot-rest, and two footstools.

I have had to\\n      do so much grubbing among old records&mdash;and to read no end of books\\n      too, Auntie.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Oh yes, I suppose so. [More confidentially, and lowering her voice a\\n      little.] But listen now, George,&mdash;have you nothing&mdash;nothing\\n      special to tell me?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      As to our journey?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      No, I don\\'t know of anything except what I have told you in my letters. I\\n      had a doctor\\'s degree conferred on me&mdash;but that I told you yesterday.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, yes, you did. But what I mean is&mdash;haven\\'t you any&mdash;any&mdash;\\n      expectations&mdash;?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Expectations?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Why you know, George&mdash;I\\'m your old auntie!\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Why, of course I have expectations.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Ah!\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      I have every expectation of being a professor one of these days.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Oh yes, a professor&mdash;\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Indeed, I may say I am certain of it. But my dear Auntie&mdash;you know\\n      all about that already!\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      [Laughing to herself.] Yes, of course I do. You are quite right there.\\n      [Changing the subject.] But we were talking about your journey. It must\\n      have cost a great deal of money, George?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Well, you see&mdash;my handsome travelling-scholarship went a good way.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      But I can\\'t understand how you can have made it go far enough for two.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      No, that\\'s not easy to understand&mdash;eh?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      And especially travelling with a lady&mdash;they tell me that makes it\\n      ever so much more expensive.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, of course&mdash;it makes it a little more expensive. But Hedda had to\\n      have this trip, Auntie! She really had to. Nothing else would have done.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      No no, I suppose not. A wedding-tour seems to be quite indispensable\\n      nowadays.&mdash;But tell me now&mdash;have you gone thoroughly over the\\n      house yet?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, you may be sure I have. I have been afoot ever since daylight.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      And what do you think of it all?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      I\\'m delighted! Quite delighted! Only I can\\'t think what we are to do with\\n      the two empty rooms between this inner parlour and Hedda\\'s bedroom.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      [Laughing.] Oh my dear George, I daresay you may find some use for them&mdash;in\\n      the course of time.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Why of course you are quite right, Aunt Julia! You mean as my library\\n      increases&mdash;eh?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, quite so, my dear boy. It was your library I was thinking of.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      I am specially pleased on Hedda\\'s account. Often and often, before we were\\n      engaged, she said that she would never care to live anywhere but in\\n      Secretary Falk\\'s villa.<a name=\"H2a\" id=\"H2a\"></a>(<a href=\"#link2\">2</a>)\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, it was lucky that this very house should come into the market, just\\n      after you had started.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, Aunt Julia, the luck was on our side, wasn\\'t it&mdash;eh?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      But the expense, my dear George! You will find it very expensive, all\\n      this.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      [Looks at her, a little cast down.] Yes, I suppose I shall, Aunt!\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Oh, frightfully!\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      How much do you think? In round numbers?&mdash;Eh?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Oh, I can\\'t even guess until all the accounts come in.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Well, fortunately, Judge Brack has secured the most favourable terms for\\n      me, so he said in a letter to Hedda.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, don\\'t be uneasy, my dear boy.&mdash;Besides, I have given security\\n      for the furniture and all the carpets.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Security? You? My dear Aunt Julia&mdash;what sort of security could you\\n      give?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      I have given a mortgage on our annuity.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      [Jumps up.] What! On your&mdash;and Aunt Rina\\'s annuity!\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, I knew of no other plan, you see.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      [Placing himself before her.] Have you gone out of your senses, Auntie?\\n      Your annuity&mdash;it\\'s all that you and Aunt Rina have to live upon.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Well well&mdash;don\\'t get so excited about it. It\\'s only a matter of form\\n      you know&mdash;Judge Brack assured me of that. It was he that was kind\\n      enough to arrange the whole affair for me. A mere matter of form, he said.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, that may be all very well. But nevertheless&mdash;\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      You will have your own salary to depend upon now. And, good heavens, even\\n      if we did have to pay up a little&mdash;! To eke things out a bit at the\\n      start&mdash;! Why, it would be nothing but a pleasure to us.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Oh Auntie&mdash;will you never be tired of making sacrifices for me!\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      [Rises and lays her hand on his shoulders.] Have I any other happiness in\\n      this world except to smooth your way for you, my dear boy. You, who have\\n      had neither father nor mother to depend on. And now we have reached the\\n      goal, George! Things have looked black enough for us, sometimes; but,\\n      thank heaven, now you have nothing to fear.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, it is really marvellous how every thing has turned out for the best.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      And the people who opposed you&mdash;who wanted to bar the way for you&mdash;\\n      now you have them at your feet. They have fallen, George. Your most\\n      dangerous rival&mdash;his fall was the worst.&mdash;And now he has to lie\\n      on the bed he has made for himself&mdash;poor misguided creature.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Have you heard anything of Eilert? Since I went away, I mean.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Only that he is said to have published a new book.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      What! Eilert Lovborg! Recently&mdash;eh?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, so they say. Heaven knows whether it can be worth anything! Ah, when\\n      your new book appears&mdash;that will be another story, George! What is it\\n      to be about?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      It will deal with the domestic industries of Brabant during the Middle\\n      Ages.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Fancy&mdash;to be able to write on such a subject as that!\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      However, it may be some time before the book is ready. I have all these\\n      collections to arrange first, you see.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, collecting and arranging&mdash;no one can beat you at that. There you\\n      are my poor brother\\'s own son.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      I am looking forward eagerly to setting to work at it; especially now that\\n      I have my own delightful home to work in.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      And, most of all, now that you have got the wife of your heart, my dear\\n      George.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      [Embracing her.] Oh yes, yes, Aunt Julia! Hedda&mdash;she is the best part\\n      of it all! I believe I hear her coming&mdash;eh?\\n    </p>\\n<pre xml:space=\"preserve\">\\n  HEDDA enters from the left through the inner room.  Her face\\n  and figure show refinement and distinction.  Her complexion\\n  is pale and opaque.  Her steel-grey eyes express a cold,\\n  unruffled repose.  Her hair is of an agreeable brown, but\\n  not particularly abundant.

Of course one has always to accustom one\\'s self to new\\n      surroundings, Miss Tesman&mdash;little by little. [Looking towards the\\n      left.] Oh, there the servant has gone and opened the veranda door, and let\\n      in a whole flood of sunshine.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      MISS TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      [Going towards the door.] Well, then we will shut it.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      HEDDA.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      No no, not that!

But he made a long, rambling\\n      speech in honour of the woman who had inspired him in his work&mdash;that\\n      was the phrase he used.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      HEDDA.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Did he name her?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      No, he didn\\'t; but I can\\'t help thinking he meant Mrs. Elvsted.

We broke up&mdash;the last of us at any rate&mdash;all\\n      together; and Brack came with us to get a breath of fresh air. And then,\\n      you see, we agreed to take Eilert home; for he had had far more than was\\n      good for him.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      HEDDA.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      I daresay.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      But now comes the strange part of it, Hedda; or, I should rather say, the\\n      melancholy part of it. I declare I am almost ashamed&mdash;on Eilert\\'s\\n      account&mdash;to tell you&mdash;\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      HEDDA.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Oh, go on&mdash;!\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Well, as we were getting near town, you see, I happened to drop a little\\n      behind the others.

Do you hear! Promise me, for\\n      Eilert\\'s sake. [Draws a parcel, wrapped in paper, from his coat pocket.]\\n      Fancy, dear&mdash;I found this.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      HEDDA.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Is not that the parcel he had with him yesterday?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      TESMAN.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Yes, it is the whole of his precious, irreplaceable manuscript!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n</pre>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n'"
